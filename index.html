        <em>This research foundation establishes the groundwork for a multi-semester capstone project in computational design practice. Building upon precedent studies from the Summer Colloquium, this proposal frames a critical area of investigation that will guide development through fall and spring terms. The framework functions as a strategic map rather than a fixed destination, positioning emerging computational design work within broader theoretical and practical contexts. Each capstone project integrates technical experimentation with rhetorical argumentation and representational innovation. This proposal will be presented to an external design jury as both a culmination of summer research and a foundation for continued exploration. The document delineates research questions, methodological approaches, and conceptual frameworks that will inform computational experiments, visual strategies, and critical arguments throughout the capstone development process.</em>

      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Refers to how digital elements in BIM, like a wall, "know" they are walls through embedded data, material type, thickness, fire rating, and cost.</p>
      <h3>Building Information Modeling (BIM)</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">A digital process that creates and manages 3D building models containing intelligent data about physical and functional characteristics. BIM enables architects, engineers, and contractors to collaborate using shared digital representations that include geometry, spatial relationships, material properties, and project lifecycle information.</p>
      <h3>Circular Construction Economy</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">Low-impact building by prioritizing material reuse and local availability.</p>
      <h3>Contextual/Critical Design</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">A design philosophy that questions the prioritization of efficiency over cultural, social, and environmental factors. It emphasizes understanding local conditions, power structures, and diverse value systems rather than applying universal solutions.</p>
      <h3>Efficiency Bias</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">The systematic tendency to prioritize speed, cost reduction, and resource optimization as primary measures of design success, often at the expense of cultural significance, environmental sustainability, social equity, and creative exploration. This bias can lead to homogenized solutions that ignore local context and community needs.</p>
      <h3>Attributes</h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px">In BIM systems, attributes are data properties assigned to building elements that define their characteristics, behaviors, and relationships. These include geometric properties (dimensions, location), material properties (thermal conductivity, strength), functional properties (load-bearing capacity), and metadata (cost, supplier, installation date).</p>

      <p>My work emerges from the revolutionary advancements made in Virtual Design and Construction methodologies, building on their potential while aligning with the growing momentum around sustainable and environmentally conscious architectural thinking. Whether or not one fully believes in the sincerity of designing “for good,” the trend is undeniably present across firms and platforms. This project takes VDC as a critical backbone—acknowledging its capacity for precision and coordination—while expanding its capabilities toward material insightfulness: to design in ways that are more local, more cultural, and more contextually responsive.</p>

      <p>The sustainable design community is addressing material transparency through three primary approaches: editorial curation that elevates material discourse through storytelling, systematic tracking frameworks for circular economy implementation, and technical integration of manufacturer data into design workflows. These approaches represent crucial progress toward democratizing material knowledge and enabling informed sustainable decisions at scale. <b>There is also increased pressure for large architecture firms to adopt sustainable and ethical practices</b> as the conversation on construction has shifted to emphasize embodied carbon, lifecycle assessments, and regulatory compliance with emerging environmental standards. There is also incredible opportunity to develop tools that integrate more nebulous aspects of the world of ethical design.</p>

      <p>My approach to computational design practice emphasizes creativity in combining existing software and tools to achieve novel insights. However, I believe this requires critical precision and deep understanding to avoid perpetuating harmful biases embedded in current systems. By carefully analyzing existing software and understanding what works, what fails, and what remains absent, we can develop intelligent systems that genuinely benefit humanity. I have been significantly influenced by Google's sophisticated methods for predicting user behavior in personalized advertising, which demonstrate both the potential and risks of data-driven design. At the forefront of my capstone development, I am actively considering these ethical questions and carefully crafting an approach to computational design practice that maintains high standards of social relevance and responsibility.</p>

      <p>Computational design and data-driven modeling techniques are becoming increasingly central to architecture, particularly through BIM's adoption as a global standard within the construction industry. I am interested in leveraging open-source material databases, spatial metadata, and circular economy datasets to explore how building elements can become context-aware and materially responsive. The project's conceptual foundation draws from theoretical frameworks in sustainable architecture, systems thinking, and material ecology. Aesthetically, the work embraces utilitarian and systems-based approaches, where visual clarity and layered information become central to architectural expression. I plan to employ both qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate spatial and material narratives alongside data-driven recommendations and mapping. The project's critical components include system/software management to enable cross-computational logic to function. User interface and experience design will become paramount during the plugin development phase.</p>

      <h3>I am arguing that digital design tools, especially BIM, must evolve from being static dictionaries of what is built to becoming parametric platforms for how we can build better. My project proposes adding more dimensionality to BIM, encouraging material ethics. Through this, I argue that buildings should no longer be assembled from abstracted, globally-sourced catalogs, but instead be rooted in the specific, often overlooked resources of their context like reused brick, salvaged timber, or urban waste. Design becomes not just form-making, but decision-making: a process where each type of wall or window is chosen not only for performance, but for provenance.<br><br>By embedding circular material intelligence and locality-aware logic into the digital modeling process, I make the case for a future where BIM tools do not just document the building, they can be a critical tool for designers to design more considerate. This is not just about efficiency, sustainability, or aesthetics. It is about redefining digital architectural intelligence itself, shifting to material responsibility.</h3>

  <h2>8/6/2025 Drawing Type</h2>
  <p>To deepen my understanding of the data trees and exchange protocols operating within and between the project's various tools, I plan to create a comprehensive diagram that adopts the visual language of web-flow diagrams and Actor-Network Theory diagrams introduced in Computational Design Workflows. This visualization will map how these systems interact and interconnect, providing me with clearer insight into the project's technical architecture and dependencies. Bellow is an example of the complexities of BIM and how I could use the large pool of existing documentation to craft a more interconnected and focused diagram for my particular interests.</p>

  <h2>8/6/2025 Material Gesture</h2>
  <p>For my material gesture, I plan to source raw material ready-mades from local marketplaces that specialize in salvaged, scrap, and reclaimed wood, brick, and steel. I will present these materials in an exhibition-style display, positioning each piece against a backdrop featuring a printed Revit properties panel with a Photoshopped section that speculatively showcases the cultural metadata of each material.</p>

      <p>Looking at the project toolkit honestly, I recognize that while my design background and undergraduate Python experience give me a solid foundation, I will be facing some significant technical integration challenges ahead. <b>The biggest gap I need to address is connecting all these tools effectively.</b> As of now, I can work with most as individual platforms, but getting machine learning outputs from Python to integrate with C# and Revit Dynamo requires extensive knowledge of data exchange protocols and APIs that I am still learning. The machine learning component is probably where I am most out of my depth; I know the theory and some math behind it, but I need to develop a much stronger understanding of the underlying algorithms, proper data preprocessing, and model validation if I want to apply this meaningfully to my project. Over the next couple of semesters, I should prioritize getting comfortable with C# and the Revit ecosystem, really using Autodesk's and the larger community's extensive publicly available tutorials to shift my focus onto C# as my coding language of choice. I also need to focus on the conceptual challenge of <b>translating my design thinking into algorithmic processes and asking the right questions.</b> This is where my dual degree should pay off, as it blends the architectural world, computational logic, and ethical frameworks found in the fields of study. My goal is to build fluency in cross-platform workflows rather than just competency in individual tools. <br><br>Designing a plugin for Revit may just be the perfect marriage of these interests since I will become more technically adept while also becoming incredibly comfortable using one of the primary tools of licensed architects. I am incredibly excited to start this two-year journey since I will be surrounded by incredibly talented professors in back-end development, custom plugin creation, and entrepreneurial know-how.</p>
